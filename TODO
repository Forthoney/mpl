Local collections:
  - New chunks need their TIDs set. How do we do this correctly?
  The most obviously correct thing would be to preserve all TIDs: for each
  object x that we are copying to the to-space, we would look up if there
  is an existing chunk in the to-space that already has TID(x), and
  copy into that chunk, or create a new chunk otherwise. More fragmentation,
  but unavoidable.
  - Debug decheck... nn benchmark is failing
