To compile you need 

0) Linux OS
1) mlton-20130715-2
on aware.aladdin.cs.cmu.edu this is 
/opt/parmem-bin/mlton-20130715-2/bin/mlton
so add the following to your path
/opt/parmem-bin/mlton-20130715-2/bin/mlton

2) To make type  at the root

$ make all-no-docs

This creates build/bin/mlton-parmem

3) Put the mlton-parmem executable directory into your path, e.g.,
   $PATH:~/mltop/build/bin/

4) An example bencmark is given in examples/fib.sml
  To compile type
  $ mlton-parmem sources.mlb
  To run type
  $ ./sources @MLton number-processors 32 --
  This will return fib 39, computed on 32 cores.
